# SecretQuest

We create multiple repositories during this hackathon, but the most important ones are the following:

 - Smart contract: https://github.com/secret-quest/TowerContract/blob/master/README.md
 - Landing page/lobby before the game: https://github.com/secret-quest/login-page-v2
 - Game platform: this repository
 - Stake page morph: https://github.com/secret-quest/morph-test

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
